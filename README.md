Yes, you can handle XML to Java object conversion in Python as well. There are several libraries in Python that can help you with this task:

### 1. **xml.etree.ElementTree**
This is a simple and efficient XML parsing library that comes with Python's standard library.

#### Example Usage:
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse('camel-routes.xml')
root = tree.getroot()

for route in root.findall('route'):
    from_element = route.find('from').text
    to_elements = [to.text for to in route.findall('to')]
    print(f'From: {from_element}, To: {to_elements}')
```

### 2. **lxml**
`lxml` is a powerful and feature-rich library for XML processing. It is not included in the standard library, but it is very popular due to its robustness and ease of use.

#### Installation:
```bash
pip install lxml
```

#### Example Usage:
```python
from lxml import etree

tree = etree.parse('camel-routes.xml')
root = tree.getroot()

for route in root.xpath('//route'):
    from_element = route.find('from').text
    to_elements = [to.text for to in route.findall('to')]
    print(f'From: {from_element}, To: {to_elements}')
```

### 3. **xmltodict**
`xmltodict` is a handy library to convert XML to a Python dictionary, making it easier to work with XML data.

#### Installation:
```bash
pip install xmltodict
```

#### Example Usage:
```python
import xmltodict

with open('camel-routes.xml') as fd:
    doc = xmltodict.parse(fd.read())

for route in doc['routes']['route']:
    from_element = route['from']
    to_elements = route['to']
    print(f'From: {from_element}, To: {to_elements}')
```

### 4. **Using PyYAML for YAML-like Configuration**
If the XML data structure is complex and you want a more Pythonic way to handle it, converting XML to YAML using `xmltodict` and then loading it with `PyYAML` might be helpful.

#### Installation:
```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

#### Example Usage:
```python
import xmltodict
import yaml

with open('camel-routes.xml') as fd:
    doc = xmltodict.parse(fd.read())

yaml_data = yaml.dump(doc, default_flow_style=False)
print(yaml_data)
```

### 5. **Creating Java Objects in Python: Using Jython or Py4J**
If you specifically need Java objects in a Java environment, consider using Jython (a Python implementation for the Java platform) or Py4J (a library that allows Python programs to dynamically access Java objects).

#### Jython Example:
- Install Jython and use it to execute Java code within Python scripts.

#### Py4J Example:
- Install Py4J and use it to connect Python and Java.
```bash
pip install py4j
```

```python
from py4j.java_gateway import JavaGateway

gateway = JavaGateway()
java_obj = gateway.jvm.com.example.JavaClass()
print(java_obj.someMethod())
```

These tools and libraries should cover most use cases for converting and manipulating XML data in Python. You can choose the one that best fits your needs based on the complexity of your XML data and the requirements of your project.
